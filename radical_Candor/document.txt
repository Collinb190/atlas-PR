| Task 1. Radical Candor Reflection |
------------------------------------
a.) I was a buyer before becoming the supervisor. My manager, Jake, let me know that I was
    over purchasing for the budget. He gave me pointers to fix the issues and I was able to 
    stay within the budget going forwards.

b.) At that moment I felt that I might not be the person for the job and disappointed in myself.
    By letting me know that it was common for buyers to have this issue starting out, and being helpful
    with positive pointers, I was able to correct this issue. The way in which my manager mentored me 
    helped me learn from this situation in a positive way.

c.) I was grateful for this feedback given to me. It allowed me to learn from my mistakes and become
    better at my position. This is what brought me to the path of being a supervisor. Without the help
    from my manager, I would not be in the position I am now.

-------------------------------------------
| Task 2. Obnoxious Aggression Reflection |
-------------------------------------------
a.) I was attempting to train a new cook at work. I was trying to explain the proper way to clean
    the grill to avoid injury. I was told by the employee "I know what I am doing I don't need to 
    do it just like you". The employee then proceeded to injure themself while attempting to do it
    the way they wanted to.

b.) In reflection on the situation, I should have made more of an effort to explain the dangers of 
    their method. The response and tone I was spoken to was not expected and this caused me to be 
    less willing to pursue my instruction. The correct action would have been to be more of a leader
    and have explained the issues better.

---------------------------
| Task 3. Ruinous Empathy |
---------------------------
a.) I had a partner project in which my partner did not respond to me for days.
    I ended up finishing the project by myself. They responded the day before it was due, 
    and tried to ask to work on the project but I refused. At the end, they ended up getting 
    the same score as me even though they did nothing for the project. I think now, they may
    have been going through something or were nervous. Though this does not excuse the situation, 
    I should have been more responsive. So I suppose they did not suffer as they got to coast on my 
    grade anyway, but this is the closest example that I have.

b.) I had another partner project where we had to rebuild an app. I could tell my partner had been 
    just copy and pasting code from another source. I ended up doing most of the project as the code
    they used would not work. In programming, it is not hard to tell if someone took something or
    created it themself. I decided to just refactor the code instead of just having the tough talk.
    I should have explained that I understand not getting the concept, but taking code from elsewhere
    will not help you learn or make the project work.

-----------------------------------------------
| Task 4. Manipulative Insincerity Reflection |
-----------------------------------------------
a.) I have not done this action at Atlas. However, at my work, I have talked to my coworkers
    about the problems the upper managers are causing. The better solution would be to ask the uppers
    to speak about the policy or rule that is causing strife and come to a solution.

----------------------
| Task 5. Future You |
----------------------
a.) I will continue to work on engaging in radical candor after my time at Atlas. I will be sure to
    speak up if I see something that can help another peer. Also, I will strive to make these situations
    as comfortable and engaging as possible.

b.) My first key takeaway is that how much you care is not enough. You must also be willing to speak up
    and challenge ideas in a positive manner. Only then can you make a positive impact on others.

c.) My second key takeaway is that being mindful of your thoughts on others actions. If you react
    in a situation with emotion and no logic, you can have a negative impact that can be hard to undo.
    For example, becoming short with someone due to your own anger can damage your message.

d.) My third key takeaway is that balance is the key. You must be able to balance your emotion
    and logic to achieve radical candor. Too much pull in one direction will offset the flow and things
    start to derail.
