When I first started at Atlas School, I had no prior knowledge or understanding of 
software development concepts. The world of coding was completely new to me, and I 
was eager to meet the challenges it would bring.

During the early stages of my journey, I frequently encountered setbacks and moments of frustration.
Being new to code, I found the process of debugging and solving problems challenging. However, these 
experiences taught me the importance of patience and the value of trial and error. I learned from each 
attempt, even when they didnâ€™t work out as expected.

One of the significant challenges I faced was adapting to collaborative work. While some partners were 
supportive and easy to work with, others presented more difficulties. Working with peers who had varying 
levels of commitment and differing work styles were valuable learning experiences.

From these challenges, I learned critical lessons in patience, collaboration, and adaptability. 
I discovered that clear communication and setting mutual expectations were crucial for successful 
teamwork. Additionally, I learned to handle frustrations by maintaining a positive attitude and 
focusing on problem-solving rather than dwelling on setbacks.
